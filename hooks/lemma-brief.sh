# This is the READ half of the loop that hooks/lemma-commit.sh writes into.
# Without it, facts go in and are never seen again — which is how a store dies,
# and it dies quietly, because nothing about an unread store looks broken.
#
# It cannot query the engine. The lemmalog MCP tools are reachable only from
# Claude, and this is a script. But the snapshot is plain TSV (FACT rows with
# `s:`/`i:` typed args), so it can be read directly — safe precisely because it
# is read-only, since the MCP server rewrites that file after every mutating
# call and would clobber anything written here.
#
# It stays silent unless there is something to act on. A SessionStart hook that
# speaks every time is a hook that gets disabled, and then the whole loop is
# dead. See hooks/internals-drift.sh, which follows the same rule.
#
# Deliberately NOT `set -e`: a hook that fails must never take session startup
# down with it. Every unresolvable case exits 0 in silence.
