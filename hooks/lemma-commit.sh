# lemma-commit - queue a commit as a candidate for assertion into lemmalog
#
# Fires on PostToolUse for Bash.
#
# lemmalog is only as good as what gets asserted into it, and asserting is a
# step you have to remember. That is the adoption risk, not the engine: a
# half-populated deductive store is worse than a prose note, because it looks
# authoritative. So assertion gets attached to a boundary that already recurs
# many times a session — the commit.
#
# Other boundaries were measured and rejected. PreCompact is elegant (the
# harness announcing it is about to forget) but fires roughly never here: the
# last manual /compact was 2026-07-25, and CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=64
# puts the automatic threshold near 640K, which 1 of 101 recent sessions
# reached. SubagentStop covered 4 sessions out of 108.
#
# This hook does NOT assert. It cannot: the lemmalog MCP tools are reachable
# only from Claude, and the MCP server rewrites its snapshot after every
# mutating call, so anything a script wrote there would be clobbered. It records
# a candidate; /lemma-drain applies judgement later, with the reasoning still in
# context. Most commits establish nothing worth keeping.
#
# It is silent by design — chrismo chose a queue over a nag, so the habit costs
# nothing at commit time. Silence is also free: plain stdout from a PostToolUse
# hook never reaches the model (the renderer allowlists only SessionStart,
# UserPromptSubmit and UserPromptExpansion), so printing here would be
# transcript-only noise.
#
# Deliberately NOT `set -e`: a hook that fails becomes model-visible noise
# attached to an unrelated tool call. Every unresolvable case exits 0 in silence.
