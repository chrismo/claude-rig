# internals-drift - warn when Claude Code's version moves past the one
#                   claude-rig's internals were last verified against
#
# Fires on SessionStart.
#
# claude-rig depends on several things Claude Code does not expose as an API:
# the session registry (~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json), the transcript .jsonl
# schema, the projects-directory path encoding, and the peer messaging protocol.
# None of that is contract; all of it can change in a point release.
#
# Claude Code upgrades itself and never runs install.sh, so a version bump is
# the only reliable moment to say "re-check the assumptions". This hook is that
# moment. It does not verify anything itself — it points at the suite that does:
#
#   bats bin/claude-contract.bats
#
# See docs/internals-contract.md for what is being asserted and why.
#
# Deliberately NOT `set -e`: a hook that fails must never take session startup
# down with it. Every unresolvable case exits 0 in silence.

# that difference is finally representable — and the difference between "we
# checked and it holds" and "we never checked on this build" is exactly what
# the contract doc means by "green suite plus a stale stamp means UNVERIFIED".

  claude-rig reads Claude Code internals that are not a supported API (session
  registry, transcript schema, peer messaging). A version change is the cue to
