# SessionStart hook: ensure sandbox is enabled in .claude/settings.local.json
#
# TODO: Currently unwired from install.sh — sandbox auto-enable was getting in
# the way more than it helped. Revisit how modern Claude Code uses the sandbox
# (allowWrite/allowRead semantics, autoAllowBashIfSandboxed, network isolation)
# and decide what should live in sandbox config vs. in PreToolUse hooks vs. not
# be enforced at all. If this script is still the right answer, re-wire it in
# install.sh; otherwise delete it.
