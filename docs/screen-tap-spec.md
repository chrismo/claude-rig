# Screen-Tap Spec

**Status:** future idea, not built. Captured from conversation 2026-05-13.

## Problem

The user often needs Claude to see what's happening on their terminal screen without giving Claude direct access to the underlying system. Concrete example: SSM'ing into an EC2, running `psql` against a prod database — Claude shouldn't have a connection, but it should be able to follow along so the user doesn't have to copy/paste output back.

The general shape: read-only shoulder-surfing. Universal across whatever app the user runs.

## The raw recipe

`script(1)` is a BSD-era utility that records every byte that hits the PTY. Wrap whatever command owns the terminal:

```
script -q -F ~/session.log <command>
```

Works at the PTY layer, so it's app-agnostic — psql, vim, an SSM session, a remote tmux. Doesn't matter. If it's on screen, it's in the log.

For SSM specifically, wrap the **local** SSM client, not the remote shell:

```
script -q -F ~/ssm.log aws ssm start-session --target i-xxxxx
```

`script` doesn't know or care that the shell is on EC2 — it's capturing bytes on your laptop's PTY.

### Flag differences (macOS vs Linux)

Classic foot-gun: the BSD and util-linux versions disagree.

| | macOS / BSD | Linux (util-linux) |
|---|---|---|
| flush on write | `-F` | `-f` |
| quiet | `-q` | `-q` |
| output file | positional | `-a` / positional |
| run a command | trailing args | `-c "cmd"` |

Mac: `script -q -F ~/log.log psql ...`
Linux: `script -f -q -c "psql ..." ~/log.log`

### Gotchas

- **TUIs are noisy.** Line-oriented tools (psql, shells, kubectl) log cleanly. Full-screen tools (vim, htop, less) dump alt-screen redraws and cursor-movement escapes — ugly but technically usable with an ANSI strip.
- **psql wants `\pset pager off`** to avoid `less` taking over and producing alt-screen junk.
- **`tee` is not a substitute.** `psql | tee` puts psql on a pipe instead of a TTY, killing readline and the pretty table formatting. `script` keeps the PTY.
- **Log grows forever.** Truncate between sessions or rotate.
- **SSM sends keepalive/heartbeat noise** that shows up as escape sequences — the ANSI strip matters more there than for plain local psql.

### Quick ANSI strip

```
sed -E 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*[a-zA-Z]//g' < session.log
# or
col -bx < session.log
```

## Automation surfaces

What's worth productizing in this repo:

### 1. A `bin/` wrapper

A small helper — call it `screen-tap` or similar — that:
- Picks the right `script` flags for the current OS.
- Defaults the log path to something predictable (e.g. `~/.claude/screen-tap/<timestamp>-<command>.log`).
- Rotates / truncates old logs.
- Optionally applies `\pset pager off`-style nudges when it detects psql in the wrapped command.

```
screen-tap psql ...
screen-tap aws ssm start-session --target i-xxx
```

Symlinked into `~/.local/bin/` by `install.sh` like the rest of `bin/`.

### 2. A companion skill for the consumer Claude

Skill at `skills/watch-screen/` that:
- Knows the default log location.
- Reads the latest log on demand.
- Applies the ANSI strip transparently.
- Surfaces a clean, line-oriented view to the Claude reading it.

Pairs naturally with `claude-pod` (see `bin/claude-pod` and the `pod-mgr` / `pod-peer` skills) — same pull-on-demand read model, different substrate (PTY log vs. Claude transcript JSONL).

### 3. Integration ideas

- **`/screen-tap start <cmd>`** — skill kicks off the wrapped command in a Ghostty split / new tab via Ghostty's keybind config or `ghostty +new-window`.
- **Multi-tap discovery.** Like `claude-pod --peers --all --since <window>` lists recently-active Claude sessions, `/watch-screen` with no args could list `screen-tap` log files modified in the last N minutes.
- **Tail-mode for live updates.** v1 stays pull-on-demand; if a use case emerges for streaming, the Monitor tool over a `tail -F` is the natural fit.

## Open questions

- **Where to store logs.** `~/.claude/screen-tap/` keeps it self-contained; `/tmp` is more disposable. Probably the former so the consumer skill has a fixed search path.
- **Log lifecycle.** Truncate on each `screen-tap` invocation? Append with rotation? Keep last N sessions?
- **Should the wrapper auto-strip ANSI into a parallel `.txt` log,** or leave stripping to the consumer? Auto-strip is friendlier for Claude; raw `.log` is friendlier for `scriptreplay`.
- **Does any of this matter enough to build,** or is `script -q -F <path> <cmd>` short enough as a shell alias that the wrapper is over-engineering? The OS-flag-difference foot-gun is the strongest argument for a wrapper.

## Out of scope

- Cross-host log shipping. v1 assumes consumer and producer are on the same machine.
- Sensitive-output redaction (passwords, secrets in psql output). Caller's responsibility.
- Replay (`scriptreplay`). The goal is live observation, not playback.

## Related

- `bin/claude-pod` (+ `skills/pod-mgr/`, `skills/pod-peer/`) — sibling tool for Claude↔Claude observation via JSONL transcripts. Originally spec'd in `docs/follow-claude-spec.md`; spec was deleted once realized.
- `script(1)` man page — note the BSD/util-linux flag divergence.
