# Manual integration test for `tab-status` TITLE DELIVERY against REAL Ghostty.
#
# NOT a CI/headless test. Must be run INSIDE a Ghostty pane (it resolves the
# pane's pts from the process tree) on macOS with Ghostty 1.3.1+ and Automation
# permission granted (first run prompts "<terminal> wants to control Ghostty").
#
# Why this exists alongside tab-status.bats:
#   - tab-status.bats covers the pure title-string logic (compute_title) and
#     runs anywhere.
#   - This covers the layer bats can't: actually delivering the title to a live
#     Ghostty tab. Hooks have no controlling terminal, so `> /dev/tty` fails;
#     deliver_title instead resolves the pane pts, marks the surface with a
#     sentinel, and uses Ghostty's `set_tab_title` action via osascript. The
#     most likely future regression is a Ghostty version bump changing the
#     scripting dictionary (e.g. dropping/renaming the set_tab_title action),
#     so keep this as the "does title delivery still work on real Ghostty?" check.
#
# Strategy: call deliver_title with a unique marker, then read back via
# AppleScript whether a tab now carries that exact title. A match proves the
# whole chain: pts resolution -> sentinel OSC -> terminal match -> set_tab_title.
#
# Usage:
#   tab-status.integration-test.sh        run the check in the current pane
