# Test suite for the 2.77-spend plugin, which is a shim.
#
# The segment it renders — "36% $121/$333 | 24h [··●··◇··] 7h" — is no longer
# built here. It is built by claude-daily-spend-statusline.sh in the
# claude-plugins marketplace repo, and this plugin shells out to it. So there
# is nothing here about colours, bar glyphs, pace or the UTC countdown: those
# belong to the upstream suite, and asserting them twice would mean this repo
# claims to own behaviour it does not.
#
# What is left to test is the shim's own contract:
#   - upstream's stdout reaches the status line unaltered, both lines and all
#   - every way upstream can be missing or fail is silent, exit 0
#
# The point of the shim is dogfooding: this machine renders its status line
# from the artifact an outside user gets, so a regression upstream shows up
# here first. That only holds if the passthrough is faithful, which is what
# the first few tests pin down.
#
# A status line must never break the prompt: every failure path is silent,
# exit 0.
