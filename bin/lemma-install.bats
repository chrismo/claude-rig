# Test suite for bin/lemma-install.
#
# The lemmalog engine lives OUTSIDE this repo and is built per machine, so a
# fresh clone of claude-rig has the hooks but no engine. Traced on a simulated
# fresh machine: hooks/lemma-commit.sh queues fine (it has no dependency on
# lemmalog at all) and hooks/lemma-brief.sh nags at every SessionStart — but
# /lemma-drain, the only thing that can clear the queue, cannot run. The result
# is a permanent warning with no in-band fix. This script is that fix.
#
# It is deliberately NOT called from install.sh. The engine needs a Rust
# toolchain and a network clone; install.sh needs to stay a fast, offline,
# settings-merging script that works on a machine that will never use lemmalog.
#
# Note the inverted convention: hooks/lemma-*.sh must fail SILENTLY and exit 0,
# because a failing hook becomes model-visible noise on an unrelated tool call.
# This is a human-invoked installer, so the opposite holds — it fails loudly and
# exits non-zero, because a silent installer that did nothing is worse than one
# that says why.
