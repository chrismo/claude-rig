# Test suite for bin/contract-record.
#
# claude-contract.bats calls this from teardown(), once per test, to turn a
# test result into a durable row. The point is the distinction the old
# docs/verified-against file could not make: a suite that ran green because
# twenty-one of its tests SKIPPED is not the same as one that confirmed them,
# and both used to write the same single version string.
#
# Two hard rules, both about never breaking what calls it:
#   - it always exits 0. It runs inside a bats teardown, and a teardown that
#     fails marks the test failed. A recording bug must never invent a
#     contract failure.
#   - anything it cannot parse is dropped silently. The suite has helper
#     tests with no assumption ID; they are not contract rows.
