# Merge claude-rig hooks into settings.json.
#
# Pattern: `values {...{hooks:{}}, ...this} | values {...this, hooks: {...this.hooks, Y: [...]}} | drop hooks.X`
#   - `values {...{hooks:{}}, ...this}` defaults hooks to {} only when it is absent:
#     the spread of `this` comes second, so a real hooks record wins. Do NOT use
#     `put hooks := {}` here — put REPLACES the field rather than merging into it,
#     which silently wiped every user-managed hook event on install.
#   - `...this.hooks` preserves any hook event types claude-rig does NOT manage (e.g.,
#     user's own SubagentStop, PreCompact, etc.).
#   - Named keys after the spread (Y, Z, ...) override per-event-type: claude-rig owns
#     those event types entirely, replacing whatever was there.
#   - `drop hooks.X` removes hook event types claude-rig used to manage but no longer
#     does (otherwise stale entries would linger forever — spread can't subtract).
#     It runs LAST, after the named keys above have guaranteed hooks is non-empty:
#     dropping the sole field of a nested record makes super emit no record at all,
#     which would write an empty settings.json.
# When retiring a hook event type from claude-rig, ADD it to the `drop` list so it
# disappears from existing settings.json on next install.
# tab-status --title sets the Ghostty tab title itself (resolves the pane's pts
# and uses Ghostty's set_tab_title action via osascript). It must NOT redirect
# to /dev/tty: hooks run with no controlling terminal, so opening /dev/tty fails
# and the command would never execute.
