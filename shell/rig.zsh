# claude-rig shell entrypoint — source this from ~/.zshrc:
#
#     source ~/modev/claude-rig/shell/rig.zsh
#
# Everything here exists for one reason: a subprocess cannot cd its caller's
# shell. The real work lives in bin/wt-new and bin/wt, which are ordinary
# tested executables that PRINT a worktree path; these functions are the thin
# halves that have to be sourced in order to cd to it.
#
# Keep them thin. Logic worth testing belongs in bin/, where bats can reach it.

# zsh expands aliases at PARSE time, so if an alias named `wt` is live when
# this file is read, `wt() {` below parses as `<alias body>() {` — a syntax
# error, not a redefinition. That is the normal path into this file, not an
# edge case: anyone migrating off the old `alias wt="source .../worktrees.sh"`
# re-sources .zshrc from a shell that still has the alias loaded, and gets
# "defining function based on alias `wt'" plus a parse error.
#
# Dropping the aliases first fixes it, because zsh parses a sourced file
# command by command — this has already run by the time the definitions below
# are parsed. Errors are suppressed since normally there is nothing to remove.
