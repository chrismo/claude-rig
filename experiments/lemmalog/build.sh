# build.sh - emit a lemmalog script for the internals contract
#
# Structure comes from contract.tsv (hand-maintained, mirrors the doc);
# observations come from docs/contract-results.tsv, which bin/contract-record
# writes as bin/claude-contract.bats runs. Nothing here is transcribed by hand
# from a test result — that was the whole flaw in the first version of this
# model, which inherited the doc's staleness and gave it a proof tree.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh | lemmalog                     # one-shot, in memory
#   ./build.sh                                # inspect the facts
#
# Then, in the engine:
#   now <yyyymmdd> ; run ; ? unverified(A) ; ? urgent(A) ; why urgent("C1")
#
# Claude reaches the same store through the lemmalog MCP tools; this path
# exists so a shell can too.
